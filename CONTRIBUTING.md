# Contributing Guidelines

If you are looking for something to help with, please have a look at the
[ISSUES](https://github.com/yakovkhalinsky/backblaze-b2/issues) or add an issue if there is something you would like to see or fix.

Make sure you use the `.editorconfig` in your IDE/editor when writing code.

Pull Requests should include:

* Updated example in README.md
* Update existing tests, or add new tests to cover code changes

If you are adding tests, add these to `/test/unit`. Make sure the test is named `fooTest.js` and
is located in a similar folder to the node module that is being tested.

Always run `npm test` before you commit.
